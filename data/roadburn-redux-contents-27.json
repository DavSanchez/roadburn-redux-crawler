What is it supposed to represent? Is it political allegory? Is it a new manifesto disguised as a song? Who are the 73 percent? Well, if these questions distract you beyond a passing curiosity and beseech immediate protest action or an urgency to take up arms, a quick dive into a search engine could probably provide some sort of satiating meaning. For example:&nbsp;</p><p>-73 percent of Republican voters questioned the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 American presidential election.&nbsp;</p><p>-Misinformation online dropped by 73 percent after Trump’s Twitter account was suspended.</p><p>-73 percent of consumers say they’re willing to pay more for a product that promises total transparency.</p><p>-73 percent of workers consider health and wellness offerings when considering a job.</p><p>-Traffic congestion dropped 73 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>-Et cetera...</p><p>But this song literally refers to none of these things. If it did, better to just throw out the music altogether and instead publish an essay fulminating against 1,2,3 and demanding ABCs of varying shapes and sizes.</p><p>Sometimes the mumbling soothsayer on the sidewalk has more insight than the town cryer on the soapbox.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the entertainment.\"</p><p><br></p>","highlight":1,"slug":"algiers-73","data_id":61,"published_at":"2021-04-16T18:15:00.000000Z","created_at":"2021-04-13T09:39:13.000000Z"}],"fresh_highlights":false,"highlights":[]}
