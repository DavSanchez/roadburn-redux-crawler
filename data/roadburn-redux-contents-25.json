      "content": "<p>This brand new track, <em>Réalgar</em>, is taken from <strong>Year Of No Light</strong>’s long-awaited upcoming new album <em>Consolamentum</em>. Clocking in at just under 13 minutes, <em>Réalgar</em> promises to be an exciting taste of what’s to come from the French five-piece. It’s been eight years since <strong>Year Of No Light</strong> released their last full-length, <em>Tocsin</em>, a boundlessly intense expression of crushing intensity and hypnotic transcendence, and <em>Réalgar</em> has us eager to hear more. </p><p>But for now, don’t be fooled into thinking this is your average kinda video clip - this is a cinematic experience all of its own. Written and codirected by <strong>Corentin Schieb</strong>, <strong>Mathias Averty</strong> and <strong>Célia le Goaziou</strong>, three young directors living in Nantes, in West of France, and as the band says it “takes the form of a dreamlike stroll around different characters lost between several realities and confronted with their inner demons.” </p><p><a href=\"https://yearofnolight.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more YONL.</a></p>",
