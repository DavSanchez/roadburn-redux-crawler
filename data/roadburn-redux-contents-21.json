One of our favourite writers covering all things loud and heavy - most often for <strong>Decibel</strong> magazine - he leapt at the chance to dive into the world of death metal.

If we hadn’t slapped a word count on this in the end, we may well have been presenting an entire book to you today, such is the depth of the genre (and Vince’s inquisitive mind!).
