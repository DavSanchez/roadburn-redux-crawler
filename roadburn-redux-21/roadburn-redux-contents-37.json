'The End Of All Things' is by far the darkest, most challenging, nihilistic, visceral, and emotional album we have ever done, from the depths of our souls to the last tears of blood. We're more than excited to share these songs with you all and especially through Roadburn Festival's sonic temple. Walk through the fire with us.“</p><p><br></p><p>If you like what you hear, you can buy the album <a href=\"https://bit.ly/crownDGTL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.</p><p><br></p>",
