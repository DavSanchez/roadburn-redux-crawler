I wasn’t sure I wanted to tell you. But at this moment it feels important to share this with you. I was raped at the tender age of nineteen by someone I trusted and had fallen in love with.

Especially the shame that comes with such trauma.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>I've ignored&nbsp;my trauma for many years. It was easier to pretend it had not happened at all, than to accept it. In the silence of lockdown there was no escaping it. To relieve myself from all this I started writing this piece of music, together with Thomas and our fellow band members Igor, Jaka, Danielle and Vincent.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>The piece is called “This Shame Should Not Be Mine”. And if you read this or if you listen to the music and something similar has happened to you I hope you realize that you are not alone.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“This Shame Should Not Be Mine” will make what has been invisible, visible.
