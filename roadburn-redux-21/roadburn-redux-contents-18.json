We slid this one into the schedule unannounced, and it wouldn't be the first time we've done so with some of our favourite Icelandic musicians... </p><p>Here's what we can tell you about this project... </p><p><strong>Marghöfða dýrið</strong> (The multi-headed beast) is taken from a 17th century curse lamenting the coming of the antichrist. The beast is spearheaded by T. alongside various session musicians at any given time. The demo EP <em>Djöfladýrkun undir jökli </em>(<em>Devil Worship under the Glacier</em>) is its first official release, coming out on LP and MC through <strong>Goatowarex</strong> and <strong>Vánagandr</strong> respectively, satirising <strong>Laxnes</strong>' novel <em>Kristnihald undir jökli</em>. The lyrics twist and mock the legacy of Protestant Christianity in Iceland from its hostile takeover of Catholic heresy in Skálholt during the middle of the 16th century into the godless, impure age of modernity.&nbsp;</p><p>The project wears its musical influences on its sleeve, paying tribute to the black metal of old without shame, citing the likes of <strong>Ildjarn</strong> and <strong>Darkthrone</strong> (among others) in its compositional approach as well as taking inspiration from old Nordic folk music and childhood memories. This is only the first of the Hydra's heads, Babylon's consort!</p>",
