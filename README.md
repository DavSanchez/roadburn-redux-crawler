# Roadburn Redux crawler

This is a quick Haskell project I made for getting the video URLs that were published during 15-18th of April 2021 as part of Roadburn Redux.

Execute this with `cabal run roadburn-redux-crawler` and the `data` directory should be populated with a bunch of `json` files gotten from the API calls and a `txt` file containing the URLs of any post that was of type `video`, which can then be fed to the download manager of your choice or whatever. I have included the contents of executing this program on the 19th of April 2021 just in case you miss them (contents will be retired on the 20th of April 2021).

Enjoy and support the bands you like!
